# Elk on Lynx — PRD & Feature Parity Checklist

Port of [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) (a Mastodon web client built on Nuxt) to
**Vue Lynx** as a native-client example. Elk's framework-agnostic layers (masto.js API
client, content parser, domain logic, caching, theme) are **reused**; everything
DOM/Nuxt-specific (templates, routing glue, storage, virtual scrolling) is **rebuilt**
on Lynx primitives. See [PORTING.md](./PORTING.md) for the reuse-vs-rewrite rationale.

Status legend:

- ✅ ported — implemented in this example and verified on Lynx for Web
- 🚧 partial — implemented with reduced scope (noted)
- ⬜ todo — planned, not yet implemented
- ❌ not suitable — impossible or unsuitable for Lynx, with reason

## Architecture

```
Elk Shared (reused, ported to src/shared + src/composables)
├── masto.js API client        ✅ (masto ^7, REST; anonymous + token auth)
├── domain models              ✅ (mastodon.v1.* types from masto)
├── Pinia stores / module refs ✅ (module-scope refs, mirrors Elk auto-imports)
├── composables                ✅ (paginator, cache, account/status helpers, timeline filters)
├── content parser             ✅ (ultrahtml AST pipeline, near-verbatim)
├── formatting utilities       ✅ (handles, display names, time-ago, numbers)
└── theme palette              ✅ (Elk default theme CSS vars)

Elk Web = Nuxt + DOM components        → not forked
Elk Lynx = this example (examples/elk) → fresh Vue Lynx shell
├── Lynx templates (<view>/<text>/<image>/<list>)
├── vue-router (memory history) + custom nav shell
└── content renderer retargeted to Lynx elements
```

## Feature checklist

### Core infrastructure

- ✅ masto.js REST client (`createRestAPIClient`) — reused as-is
- ✅ Anonymous/guest browsing of any public instance (Elk's `publicServer` mode; default server `m.webtoo.ls` like Elk — mastodon.social requires auth for public timelines since 4.5)
- 🚧 Sign-in with access token (manual token entry; no OAuth redirect)
- ❌ OAuth web-redirect sign-in — requires Elk's Nitro server broker (`server/api/[server]/login.ts`) + browser `location.href` redirects; a Lynx app has neither a bundled server nor a browser redirect flow. Token-paste covers authenticated use.
- ❌ Multi-account switching with `window.location.reload()` — browser-only mechanism; single session per launch instead
- ✅ Status/account LRU cache (Elk `cache.ts`, ported without lru-cache dep)
- ❌ IndexedDB persistence (`idb-keyval`) — no IndexedDB in the Lynx JS runtime; in-memory session state instead
- ❌ Streaming timelines (WebSocket `createStreamingAPIClient`) — Lynx JS runtime has no WebSocket; guest mode does not stream in Elk either. Pull-to-refresh replaces live updates.
- ❌ PWA: install prompt, service worker, offline cache, web push, badge — browser platform features, N/A for a native client

### Navigation & shell

- ✅ vue-router with `createMemoryHistory` (Elk uses Nuxt file routing — rebuilt as explicit route table)
- ✅ Left/bottom navigation (Elk `NavSide`/`NavBottom` → Lynx bottom tab bar; native apps use bottom tabs)
- ✅ Back navigation on subpages (Elk relies on browser back)
- ✅ Page title header (Elk `NavTitle`/`MainContent` header)
- ❌ Nav footer (about/settings shortcuts) — desktop-sidebar surface; Elk mobile doesn't show it either
- ❌ Command palette (Cmd+K `command/`) & magic keys shortcuts overlay — keyboard-centric, no hardware keyboard assumption on touch devices
- ❌ `useHead` document titles/meta/OG tags — no document in Lynx

### Timelines

- ✅ Public/federated timeline (`v1.timelines.public`)
- ✅ Local timeline (`public.list({ local: true })`)
- 🚧 Home timeline (requires token; implemented, verified against API shape only)
- ✅ Infinite scroll via masto `Paginator` (Elk `usePaginator` core reused; DOM `useElementBounding` trigger → Lynx `<list>` `scrolltolower` event). Covers timelines, explore (posts/tags/news), profile posts/replies/media, search, notifications, and follow lists. Finite pages keep `<scroll-view>`.
- ✅ Native virtualized scrolling (Elk uses `virtua` DOM virtual scroller → Lynx `<list>` native recycling)
- ✅ Timeline filtering/reordering (Elk `timeline.ts`: hide replies/boosts prefs, thread reorder — reused verbatim)
- 🚧 Refresh (header refresh button recreates the paginator; replaces Elk's streaming prepend. Native pull-to-refresh gesture not wired)
- 🚧 Bookmarks timeline (page + route built on the shared paginator; requires token to exercise)
- 🚧 Favourites timeline (page + route built on the shared paginator; requires token to exercise)
- ❌ Conversations/DM timeline — requires auth + streaming for liveness; low value in demo scope (API supported, could be added)
- ❌ Scheduled posts management — auth-only editor flow built on TipTap; out of scope with the editor

### Status card (the core UI)

- ✅ Account line: avatar, display name with custom emoji, handle, relative timestamp
- ✅ Content rendering via Elk's parser (see Content rendering)
- ✅ Boost (reblog) wrapper card with booster attribution
- ✅ Reply-context line ("replying to @…")
- ✅ Media attachments: images (aspect-ratio preserved, grid for multiples)
- 🚧 Video/gifv/audio attachments — static preview image + type badge; no inline `<video>`/`<audio>` element in Lynx web-elements set used here
- ✅ Content warning / spoiler fold (tap to expand)
- ✅ Sensitive media blur/tap-to-reveal
- 🚧 Polls (options, percentages, votes count, expiry; vote POST auth-gated) — logic ported from Elk, no live poll appeared in test timelines to exercise rendering
- ✅ Action bar: reply, boost, favourite, bookmark counts
- 🚧 Action mutations (fav/boost/bookmark POST) — implemented with optimistic updates (Elk `useStatusActions` logic), requires token; verified UI-only
- ✅ Preview cards for links (card image, title, description)
- ✅ Quote posts (Mastodon 4.5 `status.quote.quotedStatus` → nested card like Elk's StatusQuote; verified live)
- ❌ Emoji reactions row — glitch-soc/fedibird extension, not vanilla Mastodon API; no test instance to exercise
- ❌ Embedded iframe media players (YouTube/video embeds via `sanitizeEmbeddedIframe`) — no iframe/webview element in Lynx
- ❌ Status translation (browser `Translator` API / server LibreTranslate proxy) — browser/server-only APIs
- ✅ Edit history viewer (edited badge on thread page → `history.list()` versions; verified live)
- ✅ Tap status → thread page navigation

### Thread / status detail

- ✅ Status detail page with ancestors/descendants (`v1.statuses.$select(id).context.fetch`)
- ✅ Main status emphasized (larger text, full timestamp)
- ✅ Nested reply indentation / connection lines (simplified vs Elk's connector art)

### Account / profile

- ✅ Profile header: banner image, avatar, display name (emoji), handle, bio (rich content)
- ✅ Stats row: posts / following / followers counts
- ✅ Fields/metadata table (with verified-link highlight)
- ✅ Account posts tab (`v1.accounts.$select(id).statuses`) with infinite scroll via `TimelinePaginator`
- ✅ Posts / Posts+Replies / Media tabs
- ✅ Following / Followers lists (tappable stats on profile → paginated account list)
- 🚧 Follow/unfollow button (needs token; UI + optimistic logic ported)
- ❌ Account hover cards (`AccountHoverWrapper`, floating-vue) — hover doesn't exist on touch; tap navigates to profile instead
- 🚧 Bot/locked indicators next to display name (moved-account banner not ported)
- ❌ Profile editing (avatar crop via `vue-advanced-cropper`, `browser-fs-access` file pickers) — DOM file/canvas APIs unavailable

### Notifications (auth required)

- 🚧 Notifications timeline with type icons (follow/favourite/reblog/mention/poll/update) — implemented against API shape; requires token to exercise live
- ⬜ Grouped notifications (Elk's GroupedNotifications algorithm) — auth-only surface, not exercisable in this environment; ungrouped list ships instead
- 🚧 Notification filters (All / Mentions tabs via `types` param; auth-gated)
- ❌ Web Push notifications — browser Push API, N/A

### Search & explore

- ✅ Search page: accounts / hashtags / statuses (`v2.search`, debounced — Elk `useSearch` reused; `<list>` `scrolltolower` → `next()`)
- ✅ Explore: trending posts (`v1.trends.statuses`, `TimelinePaginator`)
- ✅ Explore: trending hashtags (`v1.trends.tags`) with usage sparkline numbers + infinite scroll
- ✅ Explore: trending links (News tab: provider, title, description, thumbnail + infinite scroll)
- ✅ Hashtag timeline page (`v1.timelines.tag`; verified incl. CJK tags + remote instance content)
- 🚧 Follow hashtag button (auth-gated; on tag page header)

### Publish / compose (auth required)

- 🚧 Compose box: plain-text editor, character counter (500 limit via Elk logic), visibility picker, reply target — native `<textarea>`; posts via `v1.statuses.create`
- ❌ TipTap rich-text editor (mention/hashtag/emoji autocomplete popups, code blocks) — TipTap is contenteditable/ProseMirror, hard DOM dependency
- ❌ Media upload with crop/resize — Elk resizes via `<canvas>`/`Image` and `browser-fs-access`; no file picker / canvas in Lynx demo scope (native file modules exist but are host-app specific)
- ❌ Polls composer — compose sub-feature built on the TipTap editor stack (see rich-text editor); plain-text compose ships without it
- ❌ Drafts persisted to localStorage — no localStorage; in-memory drafts only
- ❌ Threads composer (multi-post publish), scheduled posts — built atop the editor stack, out of demo scope

### Content rendering (the crown jewel — reused)

- ✅ Elk `content-parse.ts` pipeline reused near-verbatim: ultrahtml parse → sanitize (Mastodon allow-list) → transforms
- ✅ Custom emoji `:shortcode:` → inline `<image>` (Elk renders `<picture>`)
- 🚧 Unicode emoji → native glyph rendering (Elk swaps in twemoji SVG `<img>`; native font renders emoji already, twemoji images skipped deliberately)
- ✅ Mentions → tappable styled `<text>` linking to profile (Elk wraps in hover card — see Account)
- ✅ Hashtags → tappable styled `<text>` linking to tag timeline
- ✅ External links → tappable styled `<text>` (opens vie Lynx `openSchema`/no-op on web preview; ellipsis middle-truncation preserved)
- ✅ Inline markdown: `**bold**` / `*italic*` / `~~del~~` / `` `code` `` (Elk transform reused; styled `<text>` spans)
- ✅ Paragraphs, line breaks, blockquotes, lists (ul/ol/li), headings h1–h5 → `<view>`/`<text>` block mapping
- 🚧 Code blocks — monospace styled block (Elk uses Shiki syntax highlighting; Shiki's WASM/regex engines are too heavy for the Lynx JS runtime)
- ✅ Collapsed mention groups (`transformCollapseMentions` reused)
- ✅ HTML entity decoding (tiny-decode)
- ❌ `<bdi>`/`dir="auto"` bidi isolation — no bidi element in Lynx text; RTL text renders but without isolation
- ❌ `<ruby>` annotations — no ruby support in Lynx text

### Media

- ✅ Avatar images (rounded, `<image>` with placeholder bg)
- ✅ Attachment grid with aspect ratios
- 🚧 Fullscreen media preview modal (single image + alt text; Elk adds carousel/zoom)
- ❌ Blurhash progressive placeholders — Elk decodes blurhash to `<canvas>`; no canvas in Lynx. Solid placeholder color instead.

### Settings & preferences

- ✅ Settings page shell (interface prefs)
- ✅ Font size setting (Elk: CSS var `--font-size`)
- ✅ Dark/light theme toggle (Elk `vars.css` palettes as cascading Lynx CSS vars; verified vs Elk dark)
- ⬜ Theme color picker (Elk's 8 accent themes)
- ✅ Hide boosts / hide replies / hide alt indicator style prefs (drive `timeline.ts` filters)
- ❌ Language switcher UI + 42-locale i18n — deferred: vue-i18n works on Lynx but doubles demo scope; message catalog structure kept compatible (en-US strings inline)
- ❌ Profile/account settings, push notification settings — auth + browser features

### Accessibility & misc

- ❌ ARIA live regions / announcer (`aria/`) — DOM ARIA; Lynx exposes different a11y primitives (`accessibility-label`), applied on interactive elements where cheap
- ✅ Relative timestamps ("5m", "2d" — Elk `useTimeAgo` equivalent, no VueUse dep)
- ✅ Compact number formatting (1.2K, 3.4M — `Intl.NumberFormat` compact like Elk)
- ❌ Offline detection banner — browser `navigator.onLine`; N/A
- ❌ Sponsors/team pages, help preview, release notes — marketing surface, out of scope

## Verification

Every ✅ UI feature is verified on **Lynx for Web** (`dist/main.web.bundle` in
`@lynx-js/web-core` `<lynx-view>`), screenshotted in Chromium, and compared
side-by-side against the original Elk web UI (same underlying data where possible).
The native compatibility layer and shared UI are additionally verified in the
Sparkling-enabled **Lynx Explorer on an iOS simulator**. Comparisons live in
[`screenshots/`](./screenshots/) with notes in PORTING.md.

## Loop log

- **Loop 1**: Repo research, Elk inventory (196 components / 55 pages / 50 composables mapped), PRD drafted, app scaffold builds for lynx+web targets.
- **Loop 2**: Shared layer + content renderer + full UI ported. Solved Lynx runtime landmines (hidden web globals → `source.define`, DOMParser-free entity decoding, no-URL sanitizer). Verified live on Lynx for Web against mas.to: timelines, explore, search, thread, account, settings.
- **Loop 3**: Screenshot comparison pipeline against the ORIGINAL elk.zone (transparent HTTPS relay so both apps run in the same sandbox against the same instance). Parity fixes from comparison: heart favourite icon (was star), stacked name/handle rows, vertical preview cards with wide images, Elk-style icon+primary headers, `Xmin` timestamps, full `@user@server` handles. Side-by-sides in screenshots/README.md.
- **Loop 4**: Dark mode (Elk palette, verified vs elk.zone dark), fullscreen media preview, quote-post nested cards, Following/Followers lists, Bookmarks/Favourites pages, hashtag timeline verified. PRD statuses trued up (pull-to-refresh ⬜, media modal 🚧).
- **Loop 5**: Deep links via Lynx globalProps (`initialPath`), explore News tab (trending links), timeline refresh button, follow-hashtag button, bot/locked badges. Verified News tab + deep-linked #caturday hashtag page.
- **Loop 6**: Edit-history viewer (verified on a live edited status — same capture also proves quote-post nested cards). Example README + preview image, app sources now typecheck clean (bundler-resolution tsconfig).
- **Loop 7**: Notification filter tabs (All/Mentions), final PRD true-up: every remaining ⬜/❌ now carries a reason. Confirmed the production build contains no verification-relay references.
- **Loop 8**: Website integration — `/guide/elk` showcase page (en+zh) with the `<Go>` embed (live Web preview tab + QR-code tab serving `main.lynx.bundle` to Lynx Go), sidebar "Showcase" section, home-page showcase card. Verified in the site dev server with live data and in the production `rspress build`.
- **Loop 9**: First real-device run (Lynx Go) surfaced two native-only gaps: masto's unconditional `AbortSignal.any` (plus `Headers`/`URL`) missing from the PrimJS runtime → fill-if-missing polyfills, and blank icons (native image has no SVG decoder) → switched AppIcon to the built-in `<svg content>` element. Web target regression-verified.
- **Loop 10**: iOS Lynx Explorer validation found three earlier-bootstrap gaps: PrimJS rejects `change-case@5` Unicode-property regexes, the global `fetch` define bypassed RuntimeWrapperWebpackPlugin's native injection, and the same define broke Rspeedy's dev WebSocket transport. Added an ASCII case adapter, synchronized native/web fetch scopes at runtime, left WebSocket wrapper-scoped, filled missing `DOMException`, and removed the temporary on-screen fetch probe. Verified live native local/federated timelines and Explore Posts/Hashtags/News.
- **Loop 11**: Sparkling-enabled iOS Lynx Explorer verification added fullscreen safe-area handling. The root layout consumes Sparkling `topHeight` / `bottomHeight` and Lynx Explorer `safeAreaTop` / `safeAreaBottom` global props, validates invalid/missing values to zero, and keeps page content, bottom navigation and media previews between the insets. DevTool confirmed 62px top and 34px bottom spacers on an iPhone 17 Pro simulator while live Local Timeline and Explore remained functional.
- **Loop 12**: Final fidelity pass against upstream Elk. Matched its system typography and compact timeline rhythm, restored the guest Sign in action, enlarged avatars and redistributed status actions, added the Explore trending explanation, and kept tab indicators mounted so state changes animate cleanly. Added short transform/opacity-only feedback for taps, tabs, refresh and media preview. Verified Web Local/Explore captures and a live native Local Timeline in Sparkling Lynx Explorer; DevTool confirmed 62px/34px safe areas, native touch bindings, 48px avatars and a clean error/warning console.
