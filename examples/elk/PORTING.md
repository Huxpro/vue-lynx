# PORTING.md — how Elk became Elk on Lynx

This example ports [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) (a Nuxt 3 Mastodon
web client, ~196 components / 55 pages / 50 composables) to **Vue Lynx**.
Elk was **not forked**: Vue Lynx has no Nuxt (no SSR, file routing, Nitro,
auto-imports), no DOM, and different primitives. Instead, Elk's
framework-agnostic layers were extracted and its UI rebuilt on Lynx
elements. The feature-level status lives in [PRD.md](./PRD.md); this file
explains *what* was reused vs rewritten and *why*.

## Reused from Elk (and how much changed)

| Elk source | Ported to | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `masto` npm package (REST client) | dependency | none — same `createRestAPIClient` |
| `app/composables/content-parse.ts` | `src/composables/content-parse.ts` | ~95% verbatim: sanitizer allow-list, custom-emoji/markdown/named-mention/collapse-mention transforms, `treeToText`. Dropped: twemoji unicode-emoji transforms (native glyphs render already), `<bdi>`/`dir=auto` (no bidi element), `new URL` protocol check → regex (no URL in Lynx runtime) |
| `app/composables/content-render.ts` | `src/composables/content-render.ts` | same AST walk + mention/hashtag/code special-casing; **output retargeted** (see below) |
| `app/composables/paginator.ts` | `src/composables/paginator.ts` | masto `Paginator` iteration, buffering, state machine kept; DOM trigger (`useElementBounding` + `window.innerHeight` polling) → native `<list>` `scrolltolower`; streaming-prepend removed (no WebSocket) |
| `app/composables/timeline.ts` | `src/composables/timeline.ts` | verbatim (filters, `reorderTimeline`) |
| `app/composables/masto/status.ts` | `src/composables/status-actions.ts` | verbatim optimistic-update logic incl. the cancel-count API-quirk workaround; `navigateTo` → vue-router |
| `app/composables/masto/search.ts` | `src/composables/search.ts` | VueUse `debouncedWatch` inlined; `isHydrated` SSR guard dropped |
| `app/composables/cache.ts` | `src/composables/cache.ts` | `lru-cache` dep → 20-line Map LRU; same keys/API |
| `app/composables/masto/account.ts` | `src/composables/account.ts` | verbatim handle/display-name helpers |
| `app/composables/users.ts` | `src/composables/users.ts` | Elk's guest-mode (`publicServer`) design kept; multi-account persistence dropped (browser storage) |
| `app/styles/{vars,default-theme}.css` | `src/styles/theme.css` | same palette values as Lynx CSS vars on `page` |
| RemixIcon set (Elk's UnoCSS `i-ri:*`) | `src/composables/icons.ts` | same glyphs, inlined as SVG data-URIs for `<image>` (no icon-font/currentColor in Lynx) |

## Rebuilt for Lynx (and why)

### Templates: every one of them

DOM elements don't exist in Lynx. `<div>`→`<view>`, `<span>/<p>`→`<text>`,
`<img>`→`<image>`, `@click`→`@tap`, CSS via Lynx's subset (flexbox, no
`:hover`). ~20 components in `src/components` + 8 pages in `src/pages`
reimplement Elk's surfaces following the originals' layout
(`StatusCard` ≈ Elk `status/StatusCard.vue` + `StatusBody` + `StatusContent`,
`TimelinePaginator` ≈ `timeline/TimelinePaginator.vue` + `common/CommonPaginator.vue`, …).

### The content renderer (the crown jewel)

Elk's pipeline is: Mastodon HTML → `ultrahtml` AST → sanitize → transforms →
Vue vnodes. The **parse half is reused intact**. The **render half changes
its output targets**:

| Elk emits | Lynx port emits |
| --- | --- |
| `h('p', …)` | `h('text', { class: 'content-p' })` block |
| `h('a', …)` / `RouterLink` | nested `<text>` run with `onTap` → router |
| `AccountHoverWrapper` (floating-vue hover card) | tap → profile navigation (no hover on touch) |
| `<picture><source><img></picture>` custom emoji | inline `<image>` (static variant) |
| `ContentCode` (Shiki highlight) | plain mono `<text>` block (Shiki's WASM/regex engine unsuited to the Lynx runtime) |
| `<bdi>`, `dir="auto"`, `<ruby>` | dropped (no equivalents) |

Inline styling (bold/italic/del/code…) becomes nested `<text>` runs with
classes — Lynx supports inline text nesting natively.

### Virtualized timeline

Elk uses `virtua`'s DOM `WindowVirtualizer`. Lynx's native `<list>` is
already a recycling virtualized scroller, so the port's feeds are
`<list>`s with `estimated-main-axis-size-px` hints and
`lower-threshold-item-count` + `scrolltolower` driving `loadNext()` —
*less* code than the DOM version. Short finite pages (settings, compose,
thread detail) stay on `<scroll-view>`; anything that paginates without
bound (timelines, explore, profiles, search, notifications, follow lists)
uses `<list>`.

### Navigation

Nuxt file routing → explicit `vue-router` table on `createMemoryHistory`
(no browser History API). Elk's route shapes are preserved
(`/:server/@:account`, `/:server/status/:id`, `/:server/tags/:tag`, …) so
the content renderer's mention/hashtag rewrites work unchanged.

### Sessions

Elk's OAuth needs its Nitro server (`server/api/[server]/login.ts`
registers an OAuth app, browser redirects to `/oauth/authorize`). A Lynx
app has neither a bundled server nor browser redirects, so the port
supports Elk's **anonymous guest mode** (default) plus **manual
access-token sign-in** in Settings. Multi-account storage
(localStorage/IndexedDB) is out — one session per launch.

## Lynx-specific landmines (worth knowing)

1. **`fetch` lives in different scopes across targets.** Native Lynx injects
   it into RuntimeWrapperWebpackPlugin's outer wrapper, while Lynx for Web
   exposes `globalThis.fetch`. `src/polyfills.ts` selects the callable one
   and mirrors it to both scopes before masto runs. Other free-identifier web
   constructors use targeted `source.define` rewrites (no masto patches).
2. **No DOMParser anywhere** (worker or native). Elk's `tiny-decode`
   entity decoder uses DOMParser in its browser build — replaced with a
   30-line table+numeric decoder (`html-entities.ts`), sufficient for
   Mastodon's sanitized output.
3. **The native runtime is missing more than `URL`.** Per
   `@lynx-js/types`, the native background thread guarantees only `fetch`,
   `Request`, `Response` and timers. masto.js additionally calls
   `AbortSignal.any` (unconditionally, on every request — this alone
   turned every native request into "Failed to load timeline"),
   `new Headers(...)`, `new URL(path, base)`, and `DOMException` for its
   error path. `src/polyfills.ts`
   installs fill-if-missing implementations before anything else runs;
   on Lynx for Web the real worker APIs win and the native-only shims are
   inert.
4. **PrimJS cannot parse Unicode-property regexes.** `change-case@5`, pulled
   by masto.js, contains `\p{L}`/`\p{Lu}`/`\p{Ll}` expressions that abort the
   entire bundle before Vue mounts. The build aliases it to an ASCII adapter;
   Mastodon action names and response keys are ASCII by definition.
5. **The native image element has no SVG decoder.** Icons as
   `data:image/svg+xml` `<image>` sources render blank on device; the
   built-in `<svg content>` element (web: `x-svg`) renders them on both
   targets — that's what `AppIcon` uses.
6. **Fullscreen native cards must consume the host safe area.** Sparkling
   exposes iOS `topHeight` / `bottomHeight` through `lynx.__globalProps`;
   the Sparkling-enabled Lynx Explorer currently exposes the same insets as
   `safeAreaTop` / `safeAreaBottom`. `safe-area.ts` normalizes both contracts,
   and `App.vue` places all page, navigation and media-preview UI between root
   safe-area spacers. Missing, invalid and non-iOS values resolve to zero.
7. **Icons can't use `currentColor`.** SVG XML is tinted by string
   replacement per color (`icons.ts`).
8. **`new URL(path, base)` drops base paths** — relevant to the
   verification relay (below), not the app itself.

## Verification setup

The sandbox this port was built in blocks browser TLS egress (its proxy
re-terminates TLS and resets Chromium's handshake), so verification uses
two small relays in [`harness/`](./harness/):

- `serve.mjs` — serves the harness page + `dist/`, and relays
  `/api/*` → `https://<target instance>` via Node fetch (which does honor
  the sandbox proxy). Media URLs in JSON responses are rewritten through
  the relay. The app opts in via the `ELK_API_PROXY` build define — empty
  in normal builds, where it talks to `https://<server>` directly.
- `mitm.mjs` + `--host-resolver-rules=MAP * 127.0.0.1` — a transparent
  HTTPS relay so the *original* elk.zone can load in the same sandbox for
  side-by-side screenshots against the same instance.
- `shot.mjs` / `shot-elk.mjs` — Playwright capture scripts
  (coordinate-based taps; the Lynx view is closed shadow DOM).

Results: [screenshots/README.md](./screenshots/README.md).

In an unrestricted environment none of this is needed: build with
`pnpm build`, serve `harness/index.html` + `dist/`, and the app fetches
Mastodon directly.
